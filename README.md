# WiM — What I Meant

**Voice-to-intent reconstruction for Android.** Speak messy, get clean text.

WiM captures your voice, transcribes it on-device, and optionally reconstructs it through GPT to produce clean, polished text — injected directly into whatever text field you're typing in.

## How It Works

1. Enable the WiM accessibility service
2. A floating bubble appears over all apps
3. Tap the bubble to start recording, tap again to stop
4. Your speech is transcribed, cleaned, and pasted into the active text field

## Architecture

- **On-device ASR** — Android SpeechRecognizer, zero cost, zero latency, continuous listening
- **GPT reconstruction** — OpenAI API (gpt-4o-mini for L2-3, gpt-4o for L4)
- **Falcon validation** — Meaning-preservation check after reconstruction
- **Accessibility injection** — Clipboard + ACTION_PASTE into any text field
- **Floating bubble** — TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY foreground service with pulse ring animations

## Layers

| Layer | Name | What It Does | Cost |
|-------|------|-------------|------|
| I | Transcribe | On-device ASR + disfluency filter | Free |
| II | Reconstruct | GPT cleans grammar, applies tone | API |
| III | Profile | + personal vocabulary and corrections | API |
| IV | Stutter | + clinical stutter reconstruction | API |

## Features

- **4 tone settings** — Casual, Professional, Friend, Formal
- **3 situation modes** — Default, High Stress, Reading
- **DAF** — Delayed Auditory Feedback (30-300ms configurable)
- **Profile learning** — Auto-learns corrections from usage, persists across sessions
- **Disfluency filtering** — Stutter fragments, word/phrase repetitions, prolongations, fillers, false starts
- **Falcon validation** — GPT meaning-check rejects bad reconstructions
- **Risk flags** — Critical token retention, length delta, short output detection
- **OCD redo detection** — Warns on 3+ consecutive similar recordings
- **Session history** — SQLite storage of all recordings with metrics
- **Firebase Auth** — Google Sign-In with backend proxy (no API key needed for consumers)

## Two API Paths

1. **Signed in with Google** — Requests go through Cloud Function backend at `bakers-agent.cloudfunctions.net`. Server holds the API key.
2. **Local API key** — Direct OpenAI calls. Enter your `sk-proj-...` key in the app settings.

## Build & Deploy

No IDE needed. From terminal:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME="/c/Program Files/Android/Android Studio/jbr"
./gradlew.bat installDebug
```

Builds and installs directly to a connected phone via USB debugging.

## Relationship to Lavrentiy

WiM is the consumer mobile face of the [Lavrentiy voice reconstruction engine](https://github.com/gugosf114/lavrentiy). Same reconstruction philosophy, simplified for phone use. WiM implements ~20% of Lavrentiy's feature surface — the core pipeline (record, transcribe, reconstruct, inject) plus Android-specific features (floating bubble, on-device ASR, Firebase auth). Lavrentiy's clinical/analytics stack (paralinguistic detection, prosodic analysis, covert avoidance, exposure scoring, etc.) is not in WiM.

## Tech Stack

- Kotlin, Android SDK 35 (min SDK 26)
- Firebase Auth + Google Identity
- OpenAI API (Whisper + GPT)
- OkHttp for networking
- SQLite for session history
- SharedPreferences for profile and settings

## Permissions

- **Overlay** — Floating bubble over other apps
- **Microphone** — Voice recording
- **Accessibility** — Text field detection + text injection

# Session Log — March 28, 2026

## Context
Resumed work on WiM Android after terminal crash. George + Claude Code (Opus 4.6, 1M context).

## What We Did

### 1. Recovered from terminal crash
- Identified uncommitted work: Google Sign-In UI, brand plate redesign with brass screws, BubbleService drag fix
- All changes were in working tree, not lost

### 2. Bubble pulse rings — the saga
- **Original bug:** Pulse rings (radiating lines when recording) were in a separate overlay window. When dragging the bubble, rings stayed at the old position.
- **Attempted fix 1:** Removed the code that killed rings during drag, kept `syncRingPosition()`. Didn't work — `syncRingPosition()` silently failed for unknown reasons.
- **Attempted fix 2:** Replaced rings with a bezel glow/scale animation. George rejected — "makes the button heavy, harder to move."
- **Attempted fix 3:** Embedded ring views inside the bubble layout, expanded window to 200dp. Broke drag tracking due to coordinate shifts and touch area issues.
- **Final solution:** Embedded ring views in bubble.xml, fixed window at 120dp, added touch radius check (only center 30% responds to taps). Rings animate inside the bubble's own view — no separate window, no syncing needed. Moves with bubble by definition.

### 3. Continuous listening
- Android's SpeechRecognizer auto-stops on silence. George wanted toggle behavior: tap to start, tap to stop.
- Modified `OnDeviceRecognizer` to restart automatically on `onResults` and `onError` (NO_MATCH, SPEECH_TIMEOUT) when `keepListening` flag is true.
- User speaks, pauses, speaks more — all accumulated. Only stops on second tap.

### 4. Build error discovery
- `android:paintFlags="8"` in activity_main.xml is not a valid XML attribute — was causing build failures.
- Removed it. This was blocking all builds from the start.
- Discovered that `gradlew.bat installDebug` works from terminal — Android Studio (Panda 2) was never needed.

### 5. Bubble opacity bug
- `bubbleView?.alpha = 0.7f` was set after L1 processing and never reset.
- After first dictation, entire bubble permanently 70% transparent regardless of opacity setting.
- Fixed: replaced with `setBubbleIdle()`.

### 6. Size slider recalibration
- George wanted current visual size (110%) at the slider midpoint.
- Changed range from 50-150 to 70-150, default 110%.

### 7. Bubble border color
- Changed bezel stroke from gray (#AAAAAF) to orange (#EE5A24) to match timer accent.

### 8. OpenAI API key replacement
- OpenAI disabled George's API key. Confirmed with `curl` (401).
- Generated new key, wrote to `lavrentiy/api_key.txt`.
- Injected into WiM Android on Jana's phone via `adb shell run-as` SharedPreferences edit.

### 9. Installed WiM on Jana's phone
- Samsung SM-S936U connected via USB.
- `gradlew.bat installDebug` deployed directly.
- API key injected via adb.
- Google Sign-In failed ("no credentials available") — likely SHA-1 fingerprint mismatch. Deferred.

### 10. Full codebase audit (Round 1)
Ran comprehensive code audit across all 11 components. Found:
- Double text injection race condition
- Stale accessibility node causing silent injection failure
- "Ready" status blocking signed-in users
- Layer I label "Whisper only" was wrong (it's on-device ASR)
- Corrections lost when vocabulary list empty
- WhisperClient.kt and AudioRecorder.kt are dead code
- No test suites

### 11. Play Store readiness fixes (Round 1) — 5 fixes
1. `processed` flag prevents double `processText()` call
2. `node.refresh()` + Toast before accessibility paste
3. Ready status accepts `AuthManager.isSignedIn`
4. Layer I label changed to "On-device"
5. Corrections sent when `vocabulary.isNotEmpty() || corrections.isNotEmpty()`

### 12. Feature comparison: WiM vs Lavrentiy
- Full feature-by-feature comparison table (50 features)
- WiM implements ~20% of Lavrentiy's feature surface
- Core pipeline is solid; clinical/analytics stack absent
- Identified 10 "lazy" features that should have been ported

### 13. Implemented 8 of 10 improvements
1. **Critical token retention** — regex check for numbers/amounts
2. **Risk flags** — very_short_output, large_length_delta, unfinished_fragment, critical_token_lost
3. **Prolongation detection** — `\b(\w)\1{3,}(\w+)` added to DisfluencyFilter
4. **Profile learning persistence** — correctionCounts saved to SharedPreferences
5. **OCD redo detection** — Jaccard similarity, warns after 3 consecutive similar recordings
6. **Falcon validation** — GPT meaning-preservation check, rejects bad output in SAFE mode
7. **Session history** — New SessionHistory.kt with SQLite table
8. **Orange bubble border** — visual accent matching timer

Skipped: Mode settings (unnecessary for consumers), Situation presets (too presumptuous), Whisper for L4 (deferred to v2)

### 14. Full codebase audit (Round 2)
Found 5 more issues:
1. Falcon/risk flags only on direct path, not backend
2. Manifest missing PROPERTY_SPECIAL_USE declaration
3. learnFromReconstruction receiving unfiltered rawText
4. ERROR_RECOGNIZER_BUSY killing continuous listening
5. setBubbleProcessing() was a no-op stub

### 15. Play Store readiness fixes (Round 2) — 5 fixes
1. Risk flags now run on backend path too
2. Manifest: added FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE + PROPERTY_SPECIAL_USE_FGS_SUBTYPE
3. learnFromReconstruction now receives preCleaned
4. ERROR_RECOGNIZER_BUSY handled with 150ms delayed restart
5. setBubbleProcessing() shows amber state with "PROC" label

### 16. Figma attempt
- Created Figma file, built 6 sections of the settings screen
- Hit Starter plan rate limit before screenshot validation
- Abandoned. Built HTML mockup with drawing tools instead.
- Drawing mockup worked but George decided deploy-to-phone (3 seconds) is faster than mockup iteration.
